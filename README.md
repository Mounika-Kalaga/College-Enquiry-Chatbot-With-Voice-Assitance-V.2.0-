# College-Enquiry-Chatbot-With-Voice-Assitanceüéô(V.2.0).
This college query chatbot was built with RASA, an open-source machine-learning framework for creating automated text and voice-based chatbots. Before applying to a college, the supplied chatbot can answer user questions about courses, admissions, and placements.

## How to run the project:

Step 1: Install or upgrade the Python version above 3.10 if your system doesn't have Python.

Step 2: Open your code editor's terminal and create a virtual environment in your desired folder using the command: python -m venv ./venv.

Step 3. Activate the virtual environment by using the command: .\venv\Scripts\activate.

Step 4. Install the rasa library by the command: pip install rasa.

Step 5. Create an initial basic chatbot by using the command: rasa init.

Step 6. Now edit the files from our repository into your folder structure.

Step 7. Run the rasa server by using the command: rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*".

Step 8. Open a new terminal (don't close the rasa server one) and activate the environment told in step 3.

Step 8. Run the Python server to serve the front-end file (HTML) by using the command: python -m http.server.

Step 9. Open the index.HTML file into the browser and interact with the chatbot.

Step 10. Don't forget to fork our project.
